There is also vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation and a higher degree of vasodilation in skeletal muscle, which shunts blood away from the gastrointestinal tract toward skeletal muscle and causes overall <strong>reduced systemic vascular resistance<\/strong> (SVR).&nbsp;

This prolongs action potential duration and the effective refractory period, suppressing electrical foci that stimulate atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.&nbsp; It also <strong>prolongs the QT interval<\/strong> on ECG, which increases the risk of torsade de pointes;

The drug also <strong>inhibits<\/strong> the <strong>slow L-type calcium channels<\/strong> responsible for depolarization of the sinus node and atrioventricular node.&nbsp; Both effects prolong the refractory period of the conduction system to suppress arrhythmogenic foci and in doing so contribute to a <strong>decreased sinus rate<\/strong> (ie, slowed heart rate) and a <strong>prolonged PR interval<\/strong> on ECG.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>(Choice A)<\/strong>&nbsp;

Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan <em>Trypanosoma cruzi<\/em>, which is transmitted by the triatomine &#x22;kissing&#x22; bug (Reduviid family) found throughout the Americas as far north as the southern United States.&nbsp; Infection is rare in developed regions, but the disease is endemic throughout <strong>Central and South America<\/strong> where widespread open-air and thatched-roof housing exposes individuals to routine contact with the triatomine vector.<\/p><p>Years following initial infection, some individuals develop serious end-organ damage affecting the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and\/or central nervous systems.&nbsp; Cardiac disease results from a chronic parasite-induced and immune-mediated <a href=\"40761\">myocarditis<\/a> that leads to <strong>dilated cardiomyopathy<\/strong> (DCM).&nbsp; Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is relatively unique among DCMs in that there is characteristically localized <strong>apical wall thinning<\/strong> with the development of a large apical <strong>aneurysm<\/strong>.&nbsp; In addition to impairing ventricular systolic function, the aneurysm can harbor <strong>mural thrombus<\/strong> that may systemically embolize and cause stroke.&nbsp; Damage to the cardiac conduction system can also trigger <strong>ventricular arrhythmias<\/strong> (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) that can lead to sudden cardiac death (the likely cause of death in this patient).<\/p><p>The gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease result from destruction of the myenteric plexus, which can lead to progressive dilation and dysfunction of the esophagus and, less commonly, the colon.<\/p><p><strong>(Choices A, C, D, and E)<\/strong>&nbsp; Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to DCM.&nbsp; Measles, mumps, and rubella are typically vaccinated against in childhood and are potential causes of viral DCM.&nbsp; Genetic mutations of the gene encoding for the cardiac sarcomere protein titin can lead to familial DCM.&nbsp; Miners and metal workers who are exposed to high levels of cobalt can develop DCM.&nbsp; These DCMs typically involve diffuse left ventricular wall thinning, unlike the characteristic localized apical wall thinning and aneurysm development that occurs in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; DCM due to ischemic heart disease may sometimes involve localized wall thinning with aneurysm development, but it is unlikely in this young man with no evidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.&nbsp; Esophageal enlargement is also not expected with these other etiologies of DCM.<\/p><p><strong>Educational objective:<\/strong><br>Chagas disease is endemic to Central and South America and can lead to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, a dilated cardiomyopathy.&nbsp;
