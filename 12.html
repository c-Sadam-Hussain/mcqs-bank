TdP is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by QRS complexes of varying amplitude and cycle length giving the appearance that the tip of the QRS complex is &#x22;twisting&#x22; around the ECG baseline.&nbsp; TdP is differentiated from other forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia because it is always associated with a prolonged QT interval.&nbsp; It may terminate spontaneously or can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.<\/p><p>QT prolongation may be acquired or congenital.&nbsp; <strong>Acquired QT prolongation<\/strong> is most frequently caused by electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) and pharmacologic agents such as <strong>class IA and III antiarrhythmics<\/strong> (eg, quinidine, sotalol), antibiotics (eg, macrolides, fluoroquinolones), methadone, and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).&nbsp;
