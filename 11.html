Clonidine is used in the treatment of severe or refractory hypertension.&nbsp; It exerts its effects on both heart rate and blood pressure by <strong>stimulating presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors<\/strong> in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (area responsible for basal and reflex control of sympathetic activity).&nbsp; This effect results in a subsequent <strong>decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine<\/strong> and decreased sympathetic outflow causing both <strong>bradycardia<\/strong> and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.<\/p><p>Normally, to maintain cerebral perfusion while standing, a baroreceptor-mediated <a href=\"33813\">increase in sympathetic drive<\/a> causes vasoconstriction to increase peripheral resistance and increased heart rate and contractility to aid cardiac output.&nbsp; These changes facilitate a corrective increase in blood pressure to prevent a drop in cerebral perfusion.&nbsp; However, when an orthostatic stress is applied (eg, upright posture) to this patient with <strong>attenuated sympathetic outflow<\/strong> due to clonidine, she is unable to maintain cerebral perfusion and syncope results.<\/p><p>Lisinopril and amlodipine can also contribute to orthostatic syncope by impairing peripheral vasoconstriction, but their effects are not as profound as those of clonidine because they do not affect heart rate; in fact, they may result in reflex tachycardia.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice A)<\/strong>&nbsp; Decreased presynaptic release of acetylcholine occurs with certain toxins (eg, botulinum) and some medications (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).&nbsp; This effect leads to muscle weakness and does not contribute to syncope.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice C)<\/strong>&nbsp; Beta blockers (eg, atenolol) block beta-1 adrenoreceptors in the sinoatrial node, which can lead to bradycardia and contribute to orthostatic syncope.&nbsp; Clonidine does not block adrenoreceptors; it reduces central sympathetic output.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice D)<\/strong>&nbsp; Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) block calcium channels in the atrioventricular node and ventricular myocardium, resulting in slowed cardiac conduction (ie, heart rate) and decreased contractility, which can contribute to orthostatic syncope.&nbsp; Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has minimal effect on the heart and functions primarily as a direct vasodilator.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice E)<\/strong>&nbsp; Class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide) bind to and block the potassium channels responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential.&nbsp;

Patients with severe AS already have reduced cardiac output due to significant valvular obstruction, which can be exacerbated by the sudden <strong>loss of normal atrial contraction<\/strong> that contributes to ventricular filling.&nbsp; Atrial contraction is especially important for these patients as many have concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and therefore reduced LV compliance.&nbsp; As a result, they become dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate LV filling.&nbsp; Without atrial contraction, LV preload can decrease to the point of producing severe <strong>hypotension<\/strong>.&nbsp; In addition, loss of the atrial kick can result in significantly increased mean pulmonary venous pressure due to buildup of blood in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, leading to <strong>acute pulmonary edema<\/strong>.&nbsp;

The released calcium binds to troponin (cardiac muscle) or calmodulin (smooth muscle), allowing actin and myosin to interact and cause muscle contraction.<\/p><p>In contrast, the L-type calcium channels in <strong>skeletal muscle<\/strong> directly interact with RyR calcium channels to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.&nbsp; This <strong>mechanical coupling<\/strong> between the receptors allows sarcoplasmic calcium release to occur without significant influx of calcium across the plasma membrane.&nbsp; <strong>Verapamil<\/strong> is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that acts by <strong>blocking L-type calcium channels<\/strong>, preventing the initial calcium influx into cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells.&nbsp; Because skeletal muscle is not dependent on extracellular calcium influx, calcium channel blockers do not affect skeletal muscle contractility.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice A)<\/strong>&nbsp; Troponin (but not calmodulin) is responsible for contraction of both cardiac and skeletal muscle.&nbsp; Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is affected by verapamil due to its dependence on extracellular calcium to induce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice B)<\/strong>&nbsp; A rise in intracellular calcium concentration results in a structural change in the troponin complex that allows actin and myosin to interact and cause skeletal muscle contraction.&nbsp; Calcium channel blockers do not affect troponin&#39;s affinity to intracellular calcium.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice C)<\/strong>&nbsp; An elaborate T tubule system is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle but not in smooth muscle.&nbsp; T tubules are a communication of the extracellular space that allows the depolarization impulse to reach deep into the cell, nearer to the myofilaments.&nbsp; They are in close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore facilitate rapid release of intracellular calcium stores.<\/p><p><strong>(Choice D)<\/strong>&nbsp; Unlike cardiac myocytes and specialized smooth muscle tissue (eg, gastrointestinal tract, ureters), skeletal muscle does not display automaticity and contracts only in response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.&nbsp; However, the mechanical coupling between L-type and RyR calcium channels is responsible for skeletal muscle&#39;s resistance to verapamil.<\/p><p><strong>Educational objective:<\/strong><br>Contraction initiation in cardiac and smooth muscle cells is dependent on extracellular calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, which can be prevented by calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil).&nbsp; Skeletal muscle is resistant to calcium channel blockers, as calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered by a mechanical interaction between L-type and RyR calcium channels.<\/p>","explain_img":null,"photo":null,"marked_times":"84","correct_times":"52","correct_choice":"E","un_used":"1","incorrect_times":"0","a_times":"17","b_times":"3","c_times":"12","d_times":"15","e_times":"52","f_times":"0","g_times":"0","h_times":"0","i_times":"0","j_times":"0","k_times":"0","l_times":"0","m_times":"0","n_times":"0","o_times":"0","p_times":"0","q_times":"0","r_times":"0","s_times":"0","t_times":"0","total_times":"1","updat_on":"2024-09-05 01:26:10","ref":"1","id":"13699163","user_id":"75545","exam_id":"829858","ques_id":"144","answer_ch":"no","answer_status":"0","marked":"0","omitt":"0","time_spent":"0","status":"0","insertion_datetime":"2024-08-30 18:39:25","modification_datetime":"2024-08-30 18:39:25","subject_name":"Biochemistry","sys_name":"Cardiovascular System"}};
